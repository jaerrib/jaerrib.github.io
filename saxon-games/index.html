            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I've made up my own games since I was a child. Most of them were simply a way to pass time and have long
                since been forgotten; some, like <strong>Claim the Crown</strong>, had limited physical availability.
                Along the way, I began to delve into making abstract strategy games. As a fan of Hnefatafl, I wanted to
                name my games using Anglo-Saxon words to lend a quasi-historical feel to them. All of the games falling
                under this umbrella utilize the same 7x7 grid because, if they were historical, it might make sense for
                people to reuse an existing board, much like chess and checkers. As a supporter of free culture, my
                games are available under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons

            <h2>Mǽrstánas</h2>
            <aside>
                <p>The word <i>mǽrstánas</i> is the plural form of <i>mǽrstán</i>, an Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word
                    that means "a boundary-stone". <cite><a href="https://bosworthtoller.com/22190">(Source)</a></cite>
                </p>
            </aside>
            <p>Mǽrstánas involves placing stones within the squares of a 7x7 grid with the goal of creating connection
                points ("hinges") between a player's own pieces or the edges of the board in order to achieve the
                highest score. While optional, the standard rules incorporate special stones: a "thunder-stone", which
                allows players one attack per game and a "Woden-stone" which allows players to swap out one of their
                opponent's stones.

            <h2>Oferhlýp</h2>
            <aside>
                <p>The word <i>oferhlýp</i> is an Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word meaning "A leap across or over, a
                    bound". <cite><a href="https://bosworthtoller.com/24132">(Source)</a></cite>
                </p>
            </aside>
            <p>Oferhlýp is an abstract strategy game played between two players on a 7x7 grid where the objective is to
                try to eliminate the opponent's king via jumping attacks while protecting one's own king. On the
                surface, gameplay is similar to checkers (draughts). However, there are several differences:
            <ul>
                <li>Tokens may move in any direction rather than just forwards diagonally</li>
                <li>A player's own pieces may be jumped to create a more dynamic game</li>
                <li>Tokens must be jumped twice before they are removed from the board</li>
                <li>Each player has a king token that must be captured to end the game</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <section>
                Oferhlýp is my oldest "Anglo-Saxon game" and was created in 2013 while working on another game,
                <strong>Claim the Crown</strong>, which incorporated the concept of tokens with two hit points, but
                featured various types of Middle Ages themed units, like spearmen and archers, and replaced jump attacks
                with dice rolling combat. Oferhlýp is a purer abstract interpretation of that game with a focus on
                strategy over luck.

            <h2>Cyngesheall</h2>
            <aside>
                <p>The word <i>cyngesheall</i> is an Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word meaning "king's corner".
                </p>
            </aside>
            <p>Cyngesheall is my newest game, being conceived in late 2024. It, too, uses a 7x7 grid. However,
                instead of "checkers with hit points" or making connections with stones, Cyngesheall take more direct
                inspiration from Hnefatafl. Aside from the setup, the primary differentiation is that the number of
                player pieces is even instead of asymmetrical, and each player has a king, which must reach the opposite
                corner rather than an edge. It currently features the same stones as Mǽrstánas but uses them in a
                completely different manner.
