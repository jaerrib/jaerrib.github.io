Summary: An introductory post for a reimagined website

Today marks the debut of my reimagined website built using the Python-powered
static site generator, [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/)!

*Why use Pelican?*

Quite simply, I enjoy working with Python. When I was looking for an SSG to redo
my site, Pelican fit the bill. As an added bonus, it works very well with
Markdown.

*Why redo your site now?*

A few reasons really. I've been looking at SSGs in general, and my portfolio
page needed some help. The last iteration of the site was built trying to
incorporate htmx in order to be clever. It had a manilla folder kind of design
with tabs that swapped out the content displayed on the folder. Unless someone
looked at the source code, no one knew I had used htmx, so the effect was
somewhat wasted and didn't really look all the good anyway.

Another reason is that I wanted to start using a blog to post about things I've
been learning, whether it's programming or a foreign language, and I didn't
necessarily want to build a full-stack app to do it. I also didn't want to use
something like WordPress. Pelican made it easy to get things rolling and deploy
to Codeberg Pages.
