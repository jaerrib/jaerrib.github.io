## About Me

I am a Full-Stack Web Developer (Python/Django) currently working as a Systems
Support Specialist. I learned to program when I was 11 using BASIC on my Tandy
Color Computer 2. I eventually started building web sites for bands back in the
late 90s when it was far less common for musicians to have a presence on the
Internet.

I love learning, problem-solving, music, and casual gaming. Prior to my career
transition, I worked as a manager / supervisor in contract dining and injection
molding and ran a small business for two years.

I've been around music my whole life. I am a multi-instrumentalist, but my
favorite is the guitar, which I've played since I was 14. I've been involved
with various projects over the years, some as briefly as a couple of days while
others have been around for decades.

Although I don't always have the time to play, I enjoy a variety of video
games, from open-world adventure to 4x strategy. I also like board games and
have invented a few myself. Read more about those
