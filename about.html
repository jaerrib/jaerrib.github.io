<h2>About Me</h2>
<p class="fs-5">
    I am a Full-Stack Web Developer (Python/Django). I learned to program when I was 11 using BASIC on my Tandy
    Color Computer 2. I eventually started building web sites for bands back in the late 90s when it was far less common
    for musicians to have a presence on the Internet.
</p>
<p class="fs-5">
    I love learning, problem-solving, music, and casual gaming. Prior to my career transition, I worked as a manager /
    supervisor in contract dining and injection molding and ran a small business for two years.

<p class="fs-5">
    I've been around music my whole life. I am a multi-instrumentalist, but my favorite is the guitar, which I've played
    since I was 14. I've been involved with various projects over the years, some as briefly as a couple of days while
    others have been around for decades.
</p>
<p class="fs-5">Although I don't always have the time to play, I enjoy a variety of video
    games, from open-world adventure to 4x strategy. I also like board games and have invented a few
    myself. Want to know more about those? <a href="/saxon-games/index.html" target="_blank" class="folderLink">Click here</a></p>
